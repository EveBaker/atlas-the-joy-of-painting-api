# ETL: The Joy of Coding

## Overview
This project aims to explore the concept of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) by designing a database and building an API for a local public broadcasting station. The goal is to create a system that allows viewers to filter episodes of "The Joy of Painting" based on specific criteria such as the month of original broadcast, subject matter, and color palette.

## Resources
- Bob Ross Episode Data CSV
- Bob Ross Paint Color Details CSV

## Project Context
The local public broadcasting station needs a website where viewers can filter the 403 episodes of "The Joy of Painting." The data for these episodes is currently scattered across multiple files and formats. The project involves designing and building a database to store this data effectively and creating an API to access it.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Design a Database
#### Mandatory
- Review Dataset 1, Dataset 2, and Dataset 3.
- Create a design document using UML documentation for the database.
- Write SQL scripts to create the database based on the design document.
- Use any SQL database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

### Task 1: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
#### Mandatory
- Write custom scripts in any language to import data from different sources into the new database.
- Handle data inconsistencies during the transformation process to ensure accuracy in the database.
- Ensure that the data imported aligns with the database structure.

### Task 2: API Development
#### Mandatory
- Build an API that allows users to filter episodes based on criteria like month, subject matter, and color palette.
- Enable multiple filters to be used simultaneously and provide options for filtering logic (e.g., match all filters or match any filter).
- Return JSON with episode information based on the user's filter parameters.
